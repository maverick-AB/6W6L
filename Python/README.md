# Python
Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. It is dynamically-typed. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.</br></br>
In the first week we studied Python and Bash Script. We learned to build **Command Line Interfaces(CLI)** using the **argparse** library.</br>

Then, we covered the **Asynchronous IO (asyncio)** library in Python and learned about **Coroutines**.</br>
