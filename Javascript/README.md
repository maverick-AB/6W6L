# JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm programming language. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. In JS, we got introduced to **Functional Programming**, i.e., what is functional programming and how it is implemented in JS. In simple terms, functional programming is all about building functions for immutable variables (in JS, variable declaration using const). We implement functions to work with const data types.
### **Functional Programming** :</br>
In simple terms, functional programming is all about building functions for immutable variables (in JS, variable declaration using const). It is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data (those data which can be altered), and side-effects.</br>
A **Pure Function** is a function that has the following properties:
- The function return values are identical for identical arguments.
- The function application has no side-effects.
- It is similar to the mathematical definition.</br>

**Pure functions** are all about mapping stuff, pretty much similar to the mathematical definition. Also, a pure function generates the same set of output for a particular input. While this may seem obvious, functions such as ```math.random()``` give different output.</br>
A **pure function** has absolutely no **Side-Effects**.</br></br>
