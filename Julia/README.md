# Julia
Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general-purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science.Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with parametric polymorphism in a dynamic programming language; with multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm.</br>
Julia is similar to Python but much better in many aspects. Julia has immense meta programming capabilities, parallelism capabilities. It is more of a functional language. It has multiple dispatch instead of classes.</br></br>
